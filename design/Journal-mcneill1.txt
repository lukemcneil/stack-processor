Milestone 2

1) Thursday, Friday October 8-9, 2020

   [4 hours]
   Created a simulator for our stack language written in Chez
   Scheme. The simulator can take a program such as our relprime
   example and then run it, simulating the stack as a list.

   [1.5 hours]
   Wrote the RTL descriptions for add, sub, or, dup, swap, drop, and
   over. While doing this I had to figure out how we would refer to
   the stack of registers in RTL. The way I decided to do it was with
   Reg.push(value) which pushes onto the stack a value and Reg.pop()
   which pops off the top thing on the stack.
   
   I also edited our design document in response to Sid's feedback of
   M1. This includes making places for a title page, table of
   contents, executive summary, and additional sections. I then
   combined the table showing instruction description with the table
   showing opcode and funct into 1 table. I also replaced exit with
   halt, an instruction which always jumps to itself.
